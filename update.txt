The tool was previously developed using Python but has since undergone a complete rewrite in C. This transformation was aimed at enhancing its performance and accuracy. By transitioning to C, the tool now operates with significantly improved speed and precision compared to its prior Python-based iteration. This change leverages the low-level capabilities of C, allowing for faster execution and more precise handling of operations, contributing to an overall boost in efficiency and reliability.
